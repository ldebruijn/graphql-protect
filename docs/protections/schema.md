## Configuration

```yaml
# ...

schema:
  # Path to a local file in which the schema can be found
  path: "./schema.graphql"
  # Automatically reload the schema file. 
  # It will reload the contents of the file referenced by the `schema.path` configuration option
  # after each `schema.auto_reload.interval` has passed.
  auto_reload:
    # Enable automatic file reloading
    enabled: "true"
    # The interval in which the schema file should be reloaded
    interval: 5m
```
